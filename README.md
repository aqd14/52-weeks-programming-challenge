# 52-weeks-programming-challenge
Implement a project every week in year 2018. Practice comming up with problems/ideas and solving/implementing them any prefered programming language/frameworks.

## Constraints
* Describe problem solving process in details, i.e., breaking problem into smaller ones and propose solution for each one before combining to solve the original.
* The problem/idea can be derived from others' but not allowed to look at any solution code. Instead, reading surrounding references (e.g., APIs docs) or refer to recommended code snippet only for small problem as mentioned above.

## Challenge List
1. **(_Jan/15/2018 - Jan/21/2018_)** [facebook-photo-gallery](https://github.com/aqd14/facebook-photo-gallery) -- Simple web app using Facebook Graph APIs to get the list of uploaded/tagged photos then responsively layout them.

2. **(_Jan/22/2018 - Jan/29/2018_)** [where-have-they-been](https://github.com/aqd14/where-have-they-been) -- Display taken photos from Instagram on corresponding visited location in Google Maps.
